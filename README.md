# ui-plugin-example

> Prerequisites: Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js and [@angular/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/cli) installed

> This project is the result of [instructions for generating the UI plugin](https://mef.dev/en/dev_guides/first_ui_plugin.md)

## Installation

To install the necessary components, run: `npm i`.

## Content 

The basic plugin does not include any implementation of business logic. Its primary purpose is to provide the essential structure required for a plugin to function within the platform.

## Build artefact

To upload into the platform, the assembly has got to contain a specification file. It is generated by the script located in [@natec/mef-dev-platform-connector](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@natec/mef-dev-platform-connector).

To generate you should to execute the command:
```
npm explore @natec/mef-dev-platform-connector -- npm run generate-version-file
```

To build the package you can use the command below:
```
 ng build --output-hashing none --prod --single-bundle
```
After that the content of the dist folder can be uploaded into the platform.

To avoid errors, recommend using ready-made npm scripts from `package.json`.

## Deploy
There are two methods available for deploying your plugin to platform. These methods are described [here](https://mef.dev/dev_guides/first_ui_plugin.md#7-build-and-deploy).
